ArogyaAI is a comprehensive Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that bridges the gap between traditional Ayurvedic medicine and modern Artificial Intelligence. It provides both accurate disease diagnosis and personalized Ayurvedic treatment recommendations.

By utilizing a **Dual-Engine AI Architecture** (Deterministic Machine Learning + Generative AI) and strict **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, ArogyaAI provides a secure, end-to-end ecosystem for both patients and medical practitioners. The system can be run completely offline via command-line interface (CLI) or as a fully deployed cloud web platform.

## 🎯 The Problem & Solution
Traditional Ayurvedic diagnostics rely heavily on practitioner intuition, while modern medical AI models act as "black boxes" that ignore holistic factors like Doshas (Prakriti) and seasonality. Exposing raw, low-confidence ML predictions directly to patients poses a severe psychological risk.

**ArogyaAI solves this by:**
1. Combining mathematical Random Forest predictions (99%+ accuracy) with Generative LLM contextual reasoning.
2. Utilizing Explainable AI (XAI) so doctors can see *why* the AI made its decision.
3. Implementing strict Clinical Safety Guardrails that mask low-confidence predictions to prevent patient panic.

## ⚙️ How to Run & Use the System

You can run ArogyaAI in two distinct modes: **Web Mode** (for full UI/UX) or **CLI Mode** (offline, terminal testing).

### 1. Initial Setup (Required for both modes)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gaur-avvv/Arogya-AI.git
cd Arogya-AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Optional)* Train the model if the `random_forest_model.pkl` is missing:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

### 💻 Mode A: Web Interface (Full-Stack)
Run the modern React + FastAPI ecosystem.

**Start the Backend (FastAPI):**
```bash
uvicorn backend.index:app --reload
# Runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
**Start the Frontend (React):**
Open a new terminal:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### 🖥️ Mode B: CLI Assessment (Terminal)
For developers or offline scenarios wanting to talk directly to the model.
```bash
python arogya_predict.py
```
*Follow the interactive prompts to enter symptoms (e.g., "joint pain, morning stiffness"), age, dosha, etc., and get a brilliant console printout of your predicted disease and Ayurvedic protocol.*

## 🌐 Deployment Architecture (Vercel & Render)

Due to Vercel's 500MB serverless constraints and the heavy Scikit-Learn payload, this infrastructure is decoupled for the cloud:

1. **Frontend (Vercel):** The React `frontend` folder is individually deployed on Vercel. Set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to point to the secure Render backend.
2. **Backend (Render):** The FastAPI Python backend is deployed via Render using the configured `render.yaml` Blueprint. It effortlessly handles the heavy `numpy` and `pandas` memory footprints on a persistent web service.

## Enhanced Features

### 🌿 Comprehensive Dosha Selection
The system now includes a detailed Ayurvedic body type assessment with 6 constitution types:
- **Vata** (Air_Space_Constitution) - Thin/Lean: Naturally thin build, difficulty gaining weight, dry skin, cold hands/feet
- **Pitta** (Fire_Water_Constitution) - Medium: Medium build, good muscle tone, warm body, strong appetite  
- **Kapha** (Earth_Water_Constitution) - Heavy/Large: Naturally larger build, gains weight easily, cool moist skin, steady energy
- **Vata-Pitta** (Air_Fire_Mixed_Constitution) - Thin to Medium: Variable build, creative energy, moderate body temperature
- **Vata-Kapha** (Air_Earth_Mixed_Constitution) - Thin to Heavy: Variable patterns, irregular tendencies, sensitive to changes
- **Pitta-Kapha** (Fire_Earth_Mixed_Constitution) - Medium to Heavy: Strong stable build, good strength, balanced metabolism

### 📊 Calibrated Confidence Scoring
The system now uses sophisticated confidence calibration that considers the gap between the top prediction and second-best prediction to provide more realistic confidence estimates:
- Large gap between predictions: Higher confidence possible (up to 98%)
- Medium gap: Moderate confidence (up to 95%)
- Small gap: Conservative confidence (up to 85%)

### 🤖 Integrated ML + LLM Analysis
The system combines machine learning predictions with advanced LLM-powered contextual analysis. The ML model provides an initial prediction, which the LLM then evaluates against all symptoms, lifestyle factors, and environmental conditions to provide a more accurate, contextualized diagnosis with comprehensive Ayurvedic treatment plans.

🌿 Arogya AI - Personalized Ayurvedic Analysis 🌿
============================================================
💖 Your Ayurvedic Diagnosis

Predicted Disease: Arthritis (Sandhivata) [Confidence Level: 97%]

Based on your profile and symptoms, you are experiencing Arthritis (Sandhivata in Ayurveda), 
primarily caused by Vata dosha aggravation. The combination of joint pain, stiffness, swelling, 
difficulty walking, and morning stiffness are classic symptoms of this condition, especially 
prevalent during cold weather which naturally aggravates Vata.

🌿 Your Personalized Ayurvedic Plan

🩺 Condition Explained
Sandhivata (Arthritis) occurs when Vata dosha accumulates in the joints (Sandhi), causing 
pain, stiffness, and inflammation. The cold, dry qualities of Vata are particularly aggravated 
during winter, leading to reduced flexibility and increased discomfort. Ama (toxins) may also 
accumulate in the joints, further worsening the condition.

Ayurvedic Medicinal Herbs
- Sanskrit: Shallaki, Guggulu, Ashwagandha, Nirgundi
- English: Boswellia, Indian Bdellium, Winter Cherry, Vitex
- Effects: Anti-inflammatory, reduces joint pain, strengthens bones and tissues, improves 
  mobility, reduces Vata aggravation

💆 Ayurvedic Therapies
- Sanskrit: Abhyanga, Pinda Sweda, Janu Basti, Swedana
- English: Warm oil massage, Herbal bolus therapy, Knee pooling therapy, Steam therapy
- Effects: Lubricates joints, reduces stiffness, improves circulation, removes toxins, 
  alleviates pain, nourishes tissues

🥗 Dietary Recommendations

Eat This:
- Warm, cooked, and easily digestible foods
- Ghee, sesame oil, and healthy fats
- Ginger, turmeric, and warming spices
- Cooked vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, and squash
- Warm milk with turmeric before bed
- Moong dal and whole grains like rice and wheat

Avoid This:
- Cold, raw, and frozen foods
- Excess sour, salty foods (can increase inflammation)
- Refined sugars and processed foods
- Nightshade vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant) which may aggravate inflammation
- Heavy, oily, and deep-fried foods

🏃 Lifestyle Advice
- Practice gentle yoga and stretching exercises daily to maintain flexibility
- Keep joints warm, especially during cold weather
- Apply warm sesame oil massage to affected joints before bathing
- Maintain regular sleep schedule (sleep before 10 PM, wake before 6 AM)
- Stay active but avoid overexertion
- Practice stress management through meditation and pranayama

🌿 Home Remedies & Precautions
- Drink warm water with ginger throughout the day
- Apply warm sesame or castor oil to painful joints
- Use heating pads or warm compresses on affected areas
- Take turmeric milk (1 tsp turmeric in warm milk) before bed
- Gentle massage with warm oils improves circulation
- Epsom salt bath can provide relief

👤 How Treatment Affects Your Body Type
These Ayurvedic treatments specifically address Vata imbalance by providing warmth, 
lubrication, and nourishment to your joints. The warm, oily therapies counteract the 
cold, dry nature of aggravated Vata, helping restore balance and mobility. Regular 
practice will strengthen your tissues, reduce inflammation, and improve overall joint health.

⚠️ Important Note: This is a complementary Ayurvedic approach. For severe arthritis, 
persistent pain, or worsening symptoms, please consult with a qualified healthcare 
professional or rheumatologist for comprehensive medical evaluation and treatment.
